# Bandit-Linux-Notes

Documenting my journey going through the [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) game to strengthen my Linux skills.

## Purpose

I’m using this repo to:

- Build real Linux terminal experience
- Practice clear technical documentation
- Learn common commands and patterns used in DevOps

##  Structure

- `levels/levelNN.md` – Notes for each Bandit level (NN = 00, 01, 02, …)
- `images/` – Screenshots used in the notes

##  What this repo includes

- My thought process for each level  
- Commands I used and why  
- Screenshots of my progress  
- Short summaries of what I learned
